Prerequisites
You only need a modern web browser to view this project. No special server or backend environment is required as it's a purely static front-end website.

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-health-care-clone.git
(Replace your-username/e-health-care-clone with the actual repository path if it's hosted on GitHub).

Navigate to the project directory:

Bash

cd e-health-care-clone
Usage
To view the website, simply open the hospital.html file in your preferred web browser.

Bash

open hospital.html
(On Windows, you might just double-click hospital.html).

File Structure
The project directory should contain the following files:

.
├── hospital.html       # Main HTML file for the E-health care website
├── hospital.css        # Stylesheet for the website
├── hospital.js         # JavaScript for interactive functionalities
└── README.md           # This README file
(Note: If you have other files like index.html, main.css, script.js in the same directory, they belong to a separate project as identified earlier.)

Customization

hospital.html: Modify the content, add/remove sections, or change the structure.

hospital.css: Change colors, fonts, layout, and overall visual appearance.
